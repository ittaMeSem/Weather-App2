## Getting Started

**This project _will require_ a couple of dependencies to be installed for it to properly work, so i will provide them below.**

**Make sure to install all the dependencies in the correct directory. After cloning the repo, you'll be placed in `Weather-App2` directory so you'll have to change directory to the actual working one using `cd weather-app-accesa` in the console.**

## Dependencies

### `npm install`

All you have to do.
